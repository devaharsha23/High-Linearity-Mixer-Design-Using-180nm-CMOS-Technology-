High Linearity Mixer design which is designed in cadence virtuoso using 180nm CMOS technology shows good characteristics in linearity ,gain and isolation and uses the multi-tanh technique to design some new structure in order to improve linearity and gain.
First we double the transconductor level with four nmos transistors,then we tripled the transconductor level with six nmos transistors, meanwhile we keep the circuit is symmetry.Using Cadence SpectreRF,the 
circuits show better linearity and gain,yet noise figure increase,so it exists a tradeoff among these 
parameters of active mixer.
In this project,the circuit simulated in 2.4GHz down-conversion mixer with 0.18um process,IIP3 and 1dB compression point achieved 8.5dBm and 2dBm,gain is 4 dB,power assumption is 6 mW.
